                <h1>What is Smilo platform?</h1>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://smilo.io" target="_blank">Smilo</a> is a unique blockchain platform which supports the combination of hybrid transactions, hybrid smart contracts, and hybrid decentralised applications — with ‘hybrid’ referring to both public and private. Smilo's intent is to use blockchain technology to create an alternative protocol for decentralised applications.

                <p>
                    For this new hybrid Smilo platform, two types of tokens will drive the network.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smilo tokens</li>
                        <li>SmiloPay tokens</li>
                    </ul>
                    Smilo tokens are a part of the Smilo network itself, as they represent a user’s own personal shares and thus are emblematic of each user’s power to influence the network itself. SmiloPay tokens are the medium with which to pay for all service fees and upkeep of the Smilo network.
                    In total, 200 million Smilo tokens will be created, and these will generate 200 million SmiloPay tokens.

                <h1>Generate SmiloPay tokens</h1>
                <p>
                    SmiloPay tokens will be generated with every new block created till the total number of SmiloPay tokens in circulation matches 200 million. The initial supply is 0, but it will increase by 10 with every block generated. Each SmiloPay token will be distributed equally to all Smilo holders in proportion to the amount of Smilo tokens owned. Generating a block takes around 15 seconds, and after the SmiloPay token cap of 200 million is reached, the blocks stop generating SmiloPay tokens. On average, Smilo tokens will generate approximately 9.5% SmiloPay tokens each year.
